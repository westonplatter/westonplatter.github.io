I believe we have culturally forgotten the true nature of **talent**. It seems talent is measured by how many tasks can be accomplished within a constrained set of resources. The impact of this dicatomony is a disorted view of talent.

#### How work gets done
Accomplishing a task is the result of first understanding the nature of the task. Next, a person must derive and execute an approach specific to their perception of the problem. Some approaches will be unsuccessful, and thus will require multiple approach derivations. Once a given or set of approaches are successful, the task is accomplished. 

We'll term this the **solution cycle**.
	1. Understand task.
	2. Derive approach.
	3. Execute solution.
	4. Repeat 1-3 until successful (aka, NEVER GIVE UP).

#### Ruber meets the road

The problem with defining talent the old way is that step 4 is overlooked. I'd wager perserverance through multiple **solution cycles** separates truly talented people from average. That's why I hire eccentric & passionate people over smart people.
