For the last 3 years, I used light weight text editors (Sublime and Textmate) to write code.

From the beginning I was crazy about pulling in bright and syntax highlighting intensive themes. In the last 2 weeks I've been editing a ton of YAML files for my company's Ansible provisioned infrastructure. The YAML syntax highlighting wasn't working out, so I went back to straight simple black/white text with no highlighting. 

My first reaction was sadness and loss of creativity. My code looked dead. But then something happened I didn't expect. I started reading code faster and easier, and I didn't feel frustration towards non symmetrical but working bits of code. Overall, I felt my comfort and working knowledge of my codebases increase.

I think the reason why I had this experience that I've had enough time with Ruby, Javascript, System Configs, etc to subconsciously understand the code without relying on syntax coloring to explicitly inform me of behavior. It's been such a beautiful change of scenery, that I don't think I'm going to use a colored theme for a while.
