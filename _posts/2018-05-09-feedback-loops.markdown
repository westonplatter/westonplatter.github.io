Some of the most productive people I've worked with have clear vision on *what* they're doing and *why* they're doing it. I'm not talking about big picture vision stuff; no, I mean their day to day work.

If stop of one of them and ask, "why are you doing X and Y on Z codebase", they usually respond with simple and clear words. "I'm fixing the import process to validate unique SKUs to reduce analyst workloads." Further, they often know how much longer it will take to complete.

In a nutshell, productive people reduce complexity.
