It's funny.

Every time I think about writing tests for a feature or bug fix, I tell myself
that I can work faster if I write tests at the end.

And then every time I pick up someone else's code, I wish they had written
just **one test**. Not even one test per method or function, but one test per file.
It would be way easier for me to quickly change some logic, add a small test,
run the tests for that one file, and move onto the next thing.

So here's to writing one test per file to help those who haven't spent the last
2 weeks looking at my code.
