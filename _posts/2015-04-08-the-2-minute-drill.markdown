I'm on a 2 minute "get crap done" kick.

<!-- more -->

It started when I realized how much time I spend in transition at home.
EG, transition between getting home from work and leaving for a mountain trail run.
Do I really need to sit at my desk and browse the internet for 6 minutes.

**Heck, no. I'm wasting my life.**

So today, I tried setting my watch's 2 minute timer to push me to move fast
through the mundane but necessary aspects of life. I left promptly for the gym, started dinner, took a
shower, did the dishes, took care of laundry, and left for the night in 2 minute intervals.

Some things cannot be rushed, like eating dinner.

I'm trying this out for a week and will come back with the results.
