I started a new project called `ta_scanner`, [https://github.com/westonplatter/ta_scanner](https://github.com/westonplatter/ta_scanner). It's a tool to scan stocks
and futures for Technical Analysis (ta) setups, AND provide stats on past outcomes of those setups.


I'm building it to answer questions like, "which instruments have responded well to the 4 hr MACD(26, 9, 12)
in the last quarter?"
