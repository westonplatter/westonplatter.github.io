I'm a visual person, probably more than most. Whenever I get stuck and need
new insight, I sketch out my thoughts on the whiteboard or on a piece of paper.

Technical leadership needs to reiterate,
- past
- present
- future

Or even better, clarify why the team spent time on X, Y, Z and clarify current
objectives in order for the team to navigate towards valuable solutions.

Smart people like to talk about the rightness of their answers, not the present
and future goals. Progress isn't made by become more content with your current
circumstances, it comes when people focus on the next checkoint.

What's your team's current and next checkpoint?

Don't argue over precision answers.
