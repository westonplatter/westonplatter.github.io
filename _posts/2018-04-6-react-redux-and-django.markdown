Following up from the last post on changing toolsets, I dove into django and react. It's been invigorating to start fresh with a new toolset and understand home software paradigms solve similar UI and API needs.

Here's a list of helpful tutorials I've been digesting,

React + Redux setup -  https://medium.com/@notrab/getting-started-with-create-react-app-redux-react-router-redux-thunk-d6a19259f71f

Django JWT API + React - https://medium.com/netscape/full-stack-django-quick-start-with-jwt-auth-and-react-redux-part-i-37853685ab57

Sometime when it's more ready, I'll share the Options Trading app I'm working on.
