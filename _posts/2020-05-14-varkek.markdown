I have been fascinated by the capital markets since I was a kid.

Creating [fast_arrow](https://github.com/westonplatter/fast_arrow) was a fun
foray into working with financial data. But, it was just a tool to hit the
buy or sell button. It doesn't provide any reason or give a range of confidence
while taking a long or short opinion.

So, I'm headed off to build the analytics and signal generation side of the
toolbox. It's a tool I'm calling varkek for now.
