Rather than write one of those fluffy business consulting books, I want to keep
this short, actionable, and speak to strategies and tactics.

Every organization wants to be "data-driven." But what does that actually mean?

### data driven isn't

Being data-driven isn't:

- a Tableau instance
- meeting methodolody
- sales forecast methodology
- internal dashboard KPIs


### the 'why'

<!-- why are we trying to be data-driven? -->

### team

<!-- affirm current data-driven decisions -->

### process

<!-- org values -> hitting reality during decisions -->

<!-- disagreement, thoughtful disagreement -->

OIAE framework

1. Observe
2. Interpret
3. Act
4. Evaluate

### tools

<!-- tactical tools -->

### success

<!-- where have we come, how we got there, and where we're going -->

<!-- I've been consulting with three fintech companies this summer. Each organization
wanted to become more a "data-driven" culture. To work with them towards change,
I worked on various projects ranging from creating simple Excel charts/models
to building out large ETL / data processing pipelines. The end goal was to
become a data-driven culture by adopting new tools, processes, and access
accurate data.
 -->

<!-- In the end, tools & processes (Excel, charts, graphs, analytics, KPIs,
ETL pipelines, and more big data buzz words) were just tools and processes.
The new and processes are helpful and enable an organization to function
differently, but new tools do not drive change. Confusing new tools and
data-driven culture change is like confusing causation and correlation. -->

<!-- Tools are correlated with change but they do not cause change. There have to be
internal people driving towards & inviting others to take on data-driven
decision making behaviors. -->


<!--  have to have a culture that purses
knowledge, engages in thoughtful disagreement, and has clear values before you
have try to take on data-driven decision making. Thankfully, each of the three
clients did. -->

<!-- ### What I learned

If was hired for another data consulting engagement, I'd would map out the
entire organization, complile a google doc with everyone's defined role and
responsibilities, and then describe who (at the individual and team level)
needs what data.

How defining roles and responsibilities
