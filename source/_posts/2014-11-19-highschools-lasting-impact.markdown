The actual experience of going into the building.

- wore out carpet at the entry
- light alumnium door handles that I had opened manully 
- small library filled with books at least 40 years old
- walk past the teachers lounge - plain desks acculated from old office and garage sales
- pincipals office with old map of Rome
- nurses office that was 10x10
- walk down 1 very long hallway

All the door nobs were 6 inches shorter than expectd. It was an elementry retrofited for a highschool.

I was always left with the impression that school was not about the 
building, the uniforms, and other exetenal factors. School was the 
internal discipline with which we addressed the act of learning. And 
it was a very intentional and almost sacred act. A singular dedication 
of human will to deeper understand the nature of the we beheld.

Year 1 I was still curious and adjusting to the new environment, but
years 2-3, I hated it. The discipline of the will felt opressive. Then,
during year 4 I came around. My processing went from a purely analytic
approach of all knowledge to a hybrid of analytic and intuition. I 
became more focused on describing sytems of thought rather than ensuring
my answers we 100% right.  But the intellectual stuck with me through
the transition and I carried it to my advantage.

It's about the intention you have towards your work, not external realities.

What do I remember from high school?

- 2-3 hours of homework a night
- sports each fall and spring
- tachers who were amazing academics
