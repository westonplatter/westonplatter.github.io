Tried failing in the opposite direction.

You have to show interest in what other people flipply say on Twitter - I've been arogantly rejecting this.

Twitter metrics and strategies - show info graphic.

Say things that might not be well received.

Say things to generate interest rather than declare truth. So much less effort. Refreshing less effort. Get to be flippant.

Say things that get people to talk - this is different for me. Share an inviation, not a declaration.

It actaully takes deep memory to map user trends. 

Tried following

Tried hashtags, asking questions, dms.

Tried geographic targeting.

Next - follow up with blog posts and mailing list.
