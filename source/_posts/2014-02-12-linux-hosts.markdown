Describe binding services to linux ports. What does it mean to bind processes to hosts?

What is the difference between binding to, 
- 0.0.0.0
- 127.0.0.1
- localhost
- 192.168.0.0

How does this interact with `iptables` and `ufw` systems?


#### random notes

Conection refused - can mean many things.
- sending service
- sending context
- middle context
- endpoint context
- endpoint service
