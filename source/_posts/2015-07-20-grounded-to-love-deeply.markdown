"Grounded in order to love deeply"

I used to prepare for each high school morning visually scanning
[Kipling's famous poem, "If
..."](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/175772). I wish I
would have drawn deeper wisdom from it at a younger age. But, hindsight
is 20/20 and the present is the best time to instill habits I wish were
already established.

What I Iove about Kipling's advice is that he encourages character that
preserves through the darkest hour and thrives when fortune makes life
easy. I have friends I greatly admire and respect who do this well. They
believe the best about people and situations, but never break a sweat
when their hopes are seemingly destroyed. In a word, they are *grounded*.

My great grandmother was also grounded. She had this same kind of
burning perseverance. Her stories about NYC, the Great Depression, WW1,
WW2, parenting, etc were less about her experience through life's
gantlets and more about the wonder of seeing life miraculously work
itself out.

Each time we were together, either just the two of us or the entire
extended family, it felt like she saw who I was, heard me, and valued
me; I always believed she loved me. I also never remember her acting out
of spite or a degenerate heart. I think her ever-present love for people
and her persevering charisma are intimately linked. She was free to love
people deeply because she feared nothing life brought her way. We
celebrated the end of her full life in April 2015.
