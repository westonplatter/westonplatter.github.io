An open letter to people who want to learn how to program, plus my unsolicited advice to them (create & execute solutions with or without software).

<!-- more -->

------------------------------------------------------------------

Before I redirect you to requested resources, I'd like to share unsolicited advice.

When I started learning how to program, I thought that learning software frameworks & programming languages would enable me to excel as a developer. __I was wrong__. After having freelanced and worked in "coroporate" environments, I've done my best work when I ignored my technical knownledge, and "examined the details of problem".

This has led me to firmly believe that __software does not solve problems__. Applied critical thinking and execution solve problems. Software/Code is  just a medium to express the derived solution. 2 other important things, (1) most software projects fail because the project had lofty or unreal dreams that could have been realistically refined if people had critically examined the situation. (2) Secondly, finishing a project and completing initial project goals is worth a lot. You will always capture value for yourself and your client/employer when you deliver a project no matter the possible improvem

Therefore, create & execute solutions with or without software.
