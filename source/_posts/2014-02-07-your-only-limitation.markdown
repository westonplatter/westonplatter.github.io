I'm pulling an all nighter preparing to teach an "Intro to Servers" class with Girl Develop IT - Boulder. 

I thought the class would be boringly straight forward. Describe HTTP request/response cycle, setup SSH authentication for a Unix user, install NGINX, create NGINX server blocks for HTML static site and simple NGINX reverse proxy for 65 line Nodejs upload app. I was complete wrong. 

It changed when I had to start drawing pictures to explain what the heck SSH is. Yeah, the thing that you developers use every to fling code around. It turns out SSH has 3 transport layers and has 3 embedded channels barried within the 3rd transport layer. If you're like me and started your code monkey life after the rise and fall of the first internet age, I never learned about this. I was told to accept SSH and write code faster to get more crap done.

But here I am, pulling another post college all nighter and I'm loving it.

Don't get me wrong. I love sleep, AND RALLY NEED IT. I'm not encouraging all nighters. I am, however, encouraging you to joourney into "boring topics" and honestly explain how stuff works. But not through worlds. Just writing and writing about topics doesn't help. We have world with more written text than we can read. We don't need more articles and technical analysis. We need to digest the information we have. 

You're probably thinking, "Ok, you're 50/50 crazy, but what the heck. How could I better 'digest' technical info?" Score. You're asking the question. It's worth coming up with any answer.

Here's my answer. Maybe this helps you derive your own process, maybe not.

I digest information in this order: 
1) compare it to already known concepts
2) create a visual illustration
3) create state based flow

First, I start by comparing new concepts with other ideas and hopefully make an anaology. If I can get the digestion process into an analyically comparative operation I'm 3x more effective than if I'm straight up leanring new material. Second, I take the simpler aspects of the new concept and create a visual illustation. Again, I'm 3x more effective with knowledge if I have visual representation of it. As I build a expand visual illustration, I'll build out the mental model with the new concept's less simple and complex caveats. Up until now, all the knowledge and understanding I've process is devoid of state or order based dependencies. Third step for me is to introduce an order list of how the new concept can be explained by building the concept from no previous knoledge.
