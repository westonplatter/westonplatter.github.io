I hate Twitter 'favorites' and Facebook 'likes'.

### What I hate

Twitter has turned into a platform for irrelevant sqawking (ie, tweeting), and in an attempt keep oursleves engaged with unworthy content, we've collectively turned to 'favoriting' squawks (tweets). All a favorite really means is, 'I read your 140 characters, and it meant more to me than the 25 other 140-character segments I saw'. Thus, favoriting is no more than a 7th grade popularity contest with your virtual peer group.

Facebook has turned into SharePoint housing emotional metadata. And as a culture, we've been trained to think that content on facebook has value because the content comes from people we have "deep relationships" with. The people we have relationships with matter more than anything, but the content does not. It's just pictures and metadata, IE, photos of someone's puppy 4 months ago and their feelings about Tuesday's drive home. Compared to everything that could be expressed in relationships, Facebook content is junk mail. Liking Facebook content has no affect other than telling all 'like'-seeing entities that you wasted your life on said content.

### What's the alternative?

As __human beings__, we have more to be about than empty and passive FB likes and TW favorites. I am asking us, and really you, the individual reading this, to ponder how you might speak to the human soul. In my view, it's not worth speaking unless I speak to the human soul in the people I'm speaking to.

Life is incredibly short. I don't want to make it any shorter.
