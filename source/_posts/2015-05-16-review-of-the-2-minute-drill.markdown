TLDR; It's hard to do things in 2 minute intervals.

A month ago, I shared my thoughts on trying to segment everyday
tasks into executable 2 minute tasks. The goal was to get past
the boring but necessary parts of life to enjoy the unique parts.

I learned that:


(1) I'm impatient. I wanted to squeeze everything into 2 minute
blocks. I'm asking myself, "why did I try and get everything done in 2
minutes?" This warrants reflection.
(2) I struggle to make wise decisions in a 2 minute time span.
(3) I was annoyed with beeping watch alarm.
(4) I loved finishing tasks in 2 minutes.
(5) Timing myself did not change my ability to task execution.

I killed the 2 minute drill and pulled in these tactics:


(1) Ask myself if I can really do this in 2 minutes. If yes, do it.
If not, define next actions and decide best execution track.
(2) Stop using the watch timer. My own personal 2 minute tracking
works fine and solves annoying beeping.
(3) Plan times in the day devoid of 2 minute execution
intervals. I do better by balancing "sprinting" execution with longer
work intervals for creative & knowledge centric work.
(4) Invest in mentally refreshing activities & experiences. Going on 1-2
hour road bike treks helps me come back engaged and ready to invest.
