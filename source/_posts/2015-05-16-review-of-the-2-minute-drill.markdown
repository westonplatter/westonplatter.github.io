TLDR; It's hard to do things in 2 min intervals.

About a month ago, I shared my thoughts on trying to segment everyday / boring tasks into executable 2 minute chunks. The goal was to get past the boring parts (making a lunch) to enjoy the rest of life.

It kinda worked, and kinda didn't. Here's what I learned. Note: these
are my personal observations, and probably don't apply directly to your
life.

(1) I'm bad at pacing. I wanted to squeeze everything into 2 minute
blocks. I'm asking myself, "why did I try and get everything done in 2
minutes?" This warrants reflection.
(2) I struggle to make good, wise, sound decisions in 2 minutes.
(3) I was instantly annoyed with beeping alarm.
(4) I loved finishing tasks in 2 minutes.
(5) Timing myself did not change my ability to task execution.

__Revised Method__

(1) Ask myself if I can really do this in 2 minutes. If yes, do it.
If not, define next actions and decide best execution track.
(2) Stop using the watch timer. My own personal 2 minute tracking
works fine and solves annoying beeping.
(3) Plan times in the day that are devoid of 2 minute execution
intervals. I need to balance out "sprinting" executipon with longer work intervals for complex thoughts/tasks.
(4) Invest in mentally refreshing activities/experiences. I bought a
road bike and love going on 1-2 hour rides, which help me come back
fresh.
