HEADS UP - this is a quick post written for my own sake (less for those
reading). I want to remember my initial perspective on creating
effective data driven communities.

I invest my professional efforts in 3 specific data driven ecosystems,
- full time job at a micro lending company in Boulder.  
- side project trading micro loans on one of the Peer to Peer platforms.  
- community/non-profit project with 2 people from NYC.  

As I invest, I see clearly that it's hard to build a data driven
culture. Each team member needs to be intellectually
discplined responding in accoardance to measured
values rather than gut reactions. In other words,
people have to exercise discernment based on external defined facts.

Couple notes for my own sake:

#### Places where I'm weak
- asking why before I start doing work  
- thinking small before I think big  

#### Small / Significant wins
- collocating data  
- enabling non-technical users with a data exploration tool  

#### Core philosophy
Engineer data science ops to catayltically enable others.
