HEADS UP - this is a quick post written for my own sake (less for those
reading). I want to remember my initial perspective on creating
effective data driven communities.

ecosystems
- full time work
- micro lending analysis
- nyc team
- writing

Places where I'm weak
Small / Significant wins
How do I invest in others
Who am I listening to? Where am I learning?

Core philosophy - engineer data science ops to catayltically enable
others.
