It's 10pm on a Sunday night. I'm texting with the company CEO about iOS features for the next release in 2 weeks. The conversation is focused on features I described in a shared google doc. As we keep texting, my efficiency "conscience" perks up, "shouldn't you have this conversation in the google doc, not an SMS thread?".

I classify this as "commuication outside context", and I experience this constantly.

The sole objective of what I'm about to argue for is to convince you that this pattern of communcation is ineffective, and that you should communicate in the context where your ideas live. And clarfiy my background, I'm 25 years old, and I hate, absolutely hate most Y/millennial tendencies.
