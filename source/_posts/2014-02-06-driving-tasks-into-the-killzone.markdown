After reading a couple books, and looking at my work flow process, I've come to see that it's pretty messed up. 

I start off the mess by first imaging an outlandish goal - IE, building a mini Heroku. I've been told have outlanding dreams is good, but no one ever talks about how to nourish the impossible towards reality. So while my 'mini-Heroku' dream is a good thing, I focus too much on how powerful I'll feel when it's built (holy cow, I feel immature). This is a mistake. I should focus on the implemented design and functionality, and not on the "Brain, we finally took over the world moment" (don't get the reference? [watch this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5TU8o6TvNk)).

Further, I'll look at people's github repos and wish I had pulled off the same. What I don't see is the 2 years it took them of rewritting their codebase to bring it to a publically recognized peice of software. I don't see the 2 years of struggling with concepts and chatting with people on IRC to understand the caveats. I only see the finished product.
