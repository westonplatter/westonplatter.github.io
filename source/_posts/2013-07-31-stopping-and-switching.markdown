I set [lofty goals](/blog/2013/2012-in-review#goals) in January, and like many of you, I've gone after some goals, and nearly forgotten about half of them. [These](/blog/2013/2012-in-review#goals) were not the typical new year's resolution goals. [They](/blog/2013/2012-in-review#goals) did not include "workout", "spend more time with friends", etc.

I said I wanted to become a world class communicator + developer. That's a lifetime pursuit, and I'm still going hard after both. I made it to the Grand Canyon with my sister (well worth it), picked up Backbone, and quit my full time gig to work on the secret apps. I haven't: made it to the top 20 [fog](http://github.com/fog) committers, picked up nodejs, finished QuestionnaireEngine, nor read the 20 books.

Why I'm writing and what's worth noting: __measurable advancement towards goals happens when you stop working one project and switch directions.__ Yes, __stop__ working, __stop__ focusing, __stop__ thinking .... __stop__.

Please hear that I'm advocating for stopping __and switching__. Just stopping/starting over and over does not challenge you to more effectively deliver a solution. That just enforces already developed mental assumptions. Stopping work __and getting a different perspective__ is invaluable.

Here's how I try to stop/switch effectively:

* accept what I'm stopping is less than 100% complete.
* __stop.__
* evaluate impact of recent work.
* compare to pre-start-work goals.
* decide when I'll next work on the project.
* __breathe.__
* move on.
