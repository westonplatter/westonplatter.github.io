In startup culture, there's an emphasis on doing things __fast__. "Time to market", aka fastness, is often confused as a value proposition. It's not. Speed of development is one benefit of a value propostion, but it's not the substance of the actual solution you're delivering.

Often business people want software delivered sooner to accelerate business deliverables. This may make the solution __more valueable__, but the delivery date is not the project. The project is the project. 

I've felt this conflict when businesss people say that they can't do "X" until they have "Y". Therefore, engineering should deliver "Y" __faster__.  

But how do we know that "Y" equals "X"? How do we know we will generate revenue through this new feature that we're working on? How do we know it will provide the customer excitement we're forecasting?

My argument is that I would prefer to determine a more accurate cause/effect relationship between X and Y (customer needs and our solutions) instead being able to create more complex systems faster.
