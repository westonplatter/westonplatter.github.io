In startup culture, there's an emphasis on doing things __fast__. "Time to market", aka fastness, is often confused as a value proposition. It's not. Speed of development is one benefit of a value proposition, but it's not the substance of the solution you're delivering. The real value proposition is what the solution does for the customer (and getting there faster only enables the customer to do it sooner).

Business often people want software delivered sooner to accelerate objectives and realize goals. This may make a solution __more valuable__, but the delivery date is not the project. The project is the project. 

I've felt this conflict when business people say that they can't do "X" until they have "Y". Therefore, engineering should deliver "Y" __faster__.  

But how do we know that "Y" equals "X"? How do we know we will generate revenue through this new feature? How do we know it will provide the customer excitement we're forecasting? Additionally, can we obtain these outcomes with incremental deliveries of the solution?

Personally, I prefer understanding cause/effect relationships (eg, relationship between customer needs and available solutions) 10x more than the ability to create complex systems faster.

So in a phrase, "faster is not a business plan."
