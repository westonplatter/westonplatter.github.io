It's Sunday evening. I'm reflecting on my last week & the upcoming
week. I'm hungry for a rich perspective on life outside of the
tech sphere. I think my current feeling is what people experience
before they push themselves into burn out.

I'm throttling back and spending part of my summer nights reading
dead authors to see beyond current and small context to stand on
the shoulders of giants.

I have a back porch ([picture](https://instagram.com/p/3VPixrnBOh/?taken-by=westonplatter))
that's majestic after dusk. I'm starting with "If-" and other
poems by Rudyard Kipling. Suggestions welcomed and encouraged.
